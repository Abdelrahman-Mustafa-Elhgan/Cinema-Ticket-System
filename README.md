# Cinema-Ticket-System
A simple C++ program that simulates a cinema ticket booking system with admin login and bill calculation.


# 🎬 Cinema Ticket Booking System

A **simple C++ console program** that simulates the process of booking cinema tickets, designed for beginners to practice basic programming concepts like loops, conditions, user input, and simple logic flow.

This project introduces a real-world simulation of a ticketing system where an admin must first log in before customers can buy tickets. It uses fundamental C++ features to build a smooth and interactive command-line experience.

## ✅ Features

- 🔐 **Admin Authentication**  
  Only users who enter the correct admin password can access the system. Login is limited to 3 attempts for security.

- 🎫 **Fixed Ticket Pricing**  
  The price per ticket is clearly displayed before the purchase process begins, avoiding any confusion.

- 👤 **Customer Input**  
  Each customer is asked to enter their name and the number of tickets they wish to buy.

- 🧾 **Automatic Billing**  
  The total cost is automatically calculated based on the number of tickets, and a clean receipt is printed.

- 🔁 **Repeat Booking Option**  
  After one customer finishes, the system asks if another ticket purchase is needed, allowing multiple transactions in a single session.
